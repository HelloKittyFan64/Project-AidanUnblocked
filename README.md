## FAQ
- *Is this a virus or a scam?*

No. None of these things are a virus or a scam. I will check every now and then just in case though.

- *Where's the Google Drive link?*

Just click on the game you want (which is a hyperlink) and it will redirect you to the Google Drive link.

- *How can I add games?*

I'm really up for requests but I don't really have a Discord server dedicated to this cuz I kinda don't trust myself having a Discord community so I'll just add some more games in the coming weeks.

- *Will I get caught*

If you are really stupid then yes. If you've followed my advice, you should be in the green.

- *Why chose Google Drive?*

It's unblocked on school computers plus I dont want any problems on my GitHub account.

- *Why do this in the first place?*

I could cure many kids and tennagers boredom at school while adding more content to cure even more kids and teenagers boredom!
